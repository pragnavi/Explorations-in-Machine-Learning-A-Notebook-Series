# Explorations in Machine Learning: A Notebook Series

## Overview
This collection of Jupyter notebooks serves as a comprehensive guide through various machine learning concepts and applications. From simple linear regression to the complexities of model order selection and insult classification, this series provides practical implementations and discussions designed to enhance understanding of machine learning principles and practices.

## Notebooks
- `Simple_linear_regression_for_one_independent_variable.ipynb`: Introduction to linear regression with a single variable.
- `Multiple_Linear_Regression_for_Robot_Calibration.ipynb`: Application of multiple linear regression in robot calibration.
- `Gradient_Descent_Optimization.ipynb` & `Simple_Gradient_Descent_Optimizer.ipynb`: Detailed exploration of gradient descent optimization techniques.
- `GBoost_Demo.ipynb`: Demonstration of Gradient Boosting algorithms.
- `MPG_Piecewise_Regression.ipynb` & `Optimal_Lambda_MPG_Piecewise_Regression.ipynb`: Analysis of piecewise regression on MPG dataset.
- `Model_Order_Selection_for_Neural_Data.ipynb`: Techniques for selecting the optimal model order for neural data analysis.
- `Insult_Classification.ipynb`: Machine learning application in classifying text data for insult detection.
- `The_SVM_vs_Logistic_Regression_Showdown.ipynb`: Comparative analysis of SVM and logistic regression models.
- `Getting_Started_with_Numpy_Vectors.ipynb`: A primer on using Numpy for vectorized operations in machine learning.
